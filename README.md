# IDEA: Interactive Databricks Enterprise Architecture

An interactive, exportable reference architecture for the Databricks Data
Intelligence Platform. One HTML file, no build step, no dependencies, no
backend. Open it locally, or deploy it into your own Databricks workspace as an
app your teams reach from the workspace navigation.

## What it is

Most reference architectures are a picture. Someone drew it in a diagramming
tool, exported a PNG, and pasted it into a deck. It is accurate on the day it is
made, it cannot be interrogated, and adapting it to a specific customer means
starting again in the source tool, which nobody has.

IDEA is the same architecture as a live document:

- **Every box is a real product**, and clicking it opens what it is, what a
  customer would not learn from the name, its release stage, the documentation
  for the cloud you are on, the product page, and related boxes you can jump to.
- **The cloud provider is a switch.** Azure, AWS and GCP swap the storage,
  compute, identity and ingestion services, and every documentation link
  re-points at that cloud's own docs.
- **The platform is drawn in five shapes**, so the same architecture fits a
  16:9 slide, a portrait page, or a layout that has to leave room for a third
  party in the middle.
- **Release stage is a filter.** Show GA only for a procurement conversation, or
  add Beta and the previews for a roadmap one.
- **Industry is a switch too.** Sixty-three industries, each one specialising the
  sources, ingestion, teams, apps, use cases and consumers, with the medallion
  layers pointing at that industry's own data model. Every use case and every
  team is a story you can open: click a use case for the problem it solves, who
  benefits, how it is built, the components it uses and the customer stories that
  prove it; click a team for its sub-personas and the use cases they care about.
- **The flows are alive.** Every connector is a solid arrow with a glowing dot
  gliding from source to target, each on its own timing, so the board reads as
  many independent data flows rather than one static picture. The motion is
  captured in the GIF export too.
- **A guided tour** walks a first-time viewer through every control and every
  zone, and opens the detail panel on a real box so they see what a click gives
  them. It runs itself once on a first visit and replays any time from the ◎
  button in the toolbar.
- **It exports, and the export points back.** PDF and PowerPoint open on a cover
  carrying the title and a link to the exact live board the file was made from,
  then an index of the sections, the architecture, and one detailed page or slide
  per item across four sections: *Use Cases*, *Genie Agents*, *AI/BI Dashboards*
  and *Databricks Apps*, each carrying the same detail the on-screen drawer shows,
  and a closing slide that links back to the platform and the live board. The deck
  follows the theme and the Branded/Categorized choice on screen, so a categorized
  dark board exports a categorized dark deck. Plus PNG, an animated GIF that keeps
  the flow moving, and a standalone HTML copy.

## What it shows

Sources on the left, the platform through the middle, consumers on the right,
with the teams who use it and the cloud it runs on wrapped around the outside.

| Zone | What sits there |
|---|---|
| **Sources** | Structured, semi-structured, unstructured, streaming and IoT, external and partner data, and federation sources reached without copying |
| **Cloud and 3rd-party ingestion** | The cloud's own ETL services, and third-party ELT and streaming brokers that land data alongside the platform's native ingestion |
| **Platform** | Ingest, Agentic Apps, Agentic Work, Unified Governance, Agentic Data, Open Infrastructure and the medallion layers, drawn as one outline traced by a moving ring |
| **Teams** | The business and technical teams the platform is built for. A tile is a team, never a job title, and the roles inside it and the surfaces they touch are in the side panel |
| **Consumers** | BI and productivity tools, MCP and APIs, published data products, partners and platforms, operational systems, four **AI/BI Dashboards** and four **Databricks Apps**, and the agent harnesses that arrive from outside |
| **Use cases and Genie Agents** | What the platform is used for, in the band above the platform: ten use cases and four Genie Agents on every board, each Genie Agent labelled with the domain it serves, industry-neutral by default |
| **Cloud services and integrations** | The account's own storage, compute, key vault, catalog, identity and observability services |

### How to read it

| Signal | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Solid arrow** | Data moves along it, and a glowing dot glides from source to target in the direction it actually flows. Each arrow runs on its own timing, so the board reads as many independent flows rather than one synchronised pulse |
| **Dashed zone outline** | A grouping, not a boundary that data crosses |
| **The ring around the platform** | One continuous outline: the platform is one product, not a stack of separate ones |
| **Colour** | Identifies the zone, never the status. Every zone keeps its own hue in every palette and both themes |

---

## The controls

Nine controls, left to right, sitting in the header above the diagram, plus one
on the diagram itself.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | Sixty-three industries plus *Standard Reference Architecture*, searchable, every entry on one line. Specialises everything outside the platform: sources, ingestion, teams, apps, use cases and consumers. The platform itself and the cloud services band do not change |
| **Display: Branded / Categorized** | Shows every product by its commercial brand name (*Branded*), or rooted back to its generic category (*Categorized*, the default) for a room that knows the category but not the product, so SABRE reads as *Airline Reservation System*. The choice applies everywhere at once, the tiles, the detail drawers and every download, and it is remembered between visits |
| **Cloud** | Azure, AWS, GCP. Swaps the cloud services band, the cloud ETL tiles and the federation sources, and re-points every documentation link at that cloud's own docs, including the Microsoft Learn pages on Azure |
| **Dark / Light** | Follows the operating system by default, and remembers an explicit choice. Downloads follow whatever is on screen |
| **Palette** | Thirteen colour schemes in three groups |
| **Style** | Five platform shapes |
| **Stage** | Filters the platform box by release stage |
| **Download** | PDF, PowerPoint, PNG, GIF, HTML |
| **Tour** (the ◎ at the end of the toolbar) | A guided walk-through that spotlights each control and each zone in turn, opens the detail panel on a real box so you see what a click gives you, and runs itself once on a first visit. Replayable any time |
| **Zoom** (on the platform heading, not the toolbar) | Zooms into the platform on its own: hides sources, consumers, the apps band and the cloud services. Click again to restore. Exports respect it, and the button itself never appears in one |

Everything that acts on a diagram goes inert on a tab that has no diagram yet,
so the toolbar cannot be used against nothing. Dark/Light and Cloud stay live,
because they are global and are the two things worth setting before a diagram
exists.

Industry, cloud, shape, palette, theme and platform zoom are each a URL
parameter, so a board can be linked to in the state it was read in:
`?industry=airlines&cloud=aws&shape=h90&pal=nordic&theme=light&platform=1`. That
is the link the PDF and PowerPoint covers carry. The Branded/Categorized choice
is remembered locally rather than in the link, so a shared URL opens in the
reader's own preferred naming.

### Industry: sixty-three models, and the same board size for each

The industry list follows the
[Databricks Industry Data Models](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/lakehouse-industry-data-models/tree/main/data-models)
catalogue and extends it: airlines is the reference, and sixty-two more are
authored to the same depth, spanning finance, healthcare and life sciences,
public sector, manufacturing and energy, retail and consumer, media, technology,
professional services and more. Picking one rewrites the four zones outside the
platform, and the medallion layers start pointing at that industry's own folder
in the repository.

Every industry is written to the same schema as the airlines reference: real,
current vendor systems in the sources and ingestion, teams broken into
sub-personas, four apps and ten use cases, and each use case carrying a problem
statement, its beneficiary, how it is built, the architecture components it
touches, and links to matching Databricks customer stories. Use cases with a
story sort ahead of those without, so the board leads with proof.

An industry board is held to the reference board's height, which matters more
than it sounds: the board is scaled to fit, so one industry carrying a few more
tiles than the rest would render every label in that industry smaller. Teams and
ingestion each get a fixed pocket, eight tiles and three groups, and industry
content is written to that budget rather than allowed to grow past it.
`tools/heightgate.py` measures every industry against the reference in all five
shapes and fails on a board that is taller, a label that is clipped, or a label
that only fits by wrapping.

### Every industry, one click away

Each name opens the live board specialised for that industry: its own sources
and ingestion, its own teams, its own four apps and ten use cases, its own
consumers, and the medallion layers pointing at that industry's data model. Add
`&cloud=aws` or `&cloud=gcp` to any link to open it on that cloud; the default
is Azure.

Sixty-three industries in all, plus the industry-neutral
[Standard Reference Architecture](https://amralieg.github.io/interactive-databricks-enterprise-architecture/)
that every board starts from.

### Style: five platform shapes

![The five platform shapes](docs/screenshot-shapes.png)

| Shape | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| **Z** | The default. Ingest reaches left over the sources, serving reaches right over the consumers |
| **S** | The Z mirrored, for when the story runs right to left |
| **T** | Both arms on top, for a wide slide with a short middle |
| **T180** | Both arms underneath |
| **H90** | A full I-beam: three rows with split arms and pockets inside the notches, which is what leaves room for the cloud and third-party ingestion to sit *inside* the shape rather than beside it |

Every shape is measured, not eyeballed: the two pockets are equalised to the
taller one, so the arms stay symmetrical to the pixel in all five.

H90 works differently enough from the other four to be worth spelling out. Each
pocket splits into two labelled boxes side by side, Cloud ETL beside 3rd Party
and Business beside Technical, and each box runs its tiles down a single column.
Both pockets sit inside their own arm column rather than spanning the middle, so
the crossbar of the I stays clear, and the governance band renders there instead
of in the lower block: the narrow middle of the shape carries the platform's
control plane rather than being a spacer. The arms are wider here than in the
other shapes to fit those boxes, and the design canvas is wider to match, which
is free because the fit in this shape is bound by height rather than width.

![H90, the full board](docs/screenshot-h90.png)

### Palette: thirteen schemes, solved rather than picked

![Six of the thirteen palettes](docs/screenshot-palettes.png)

| Group | Palettes |
|---|---|
| **Neutral** | Spectrum (default), Mono (print safe), Muted (low chroma), Nordic (cool calm) |
| **Coloured** | Ocean (analogous), Earth (warm neutral), Sunset (warm shift), Berry (cool warm) |
| **Loud** | Solid (filled), Jewel (deep), Vivid (projector), Pop (playful), Neon (maximum) |

`tools/palgen.py` generates all of them. For every zone hue it walks lightness
until four values clear WCAG AA against the surface each one actually sits on,
in both themes: the zone fill, the chip tile inside it, the border, and the ink
on top. Nothing here is hand-picked, which is why Neon is legible and Mono
survives a black and white printer.

Spectrum keeps the chips white so the reference reads as a document. Every other
palette tints the chips too, so a palette choice is visible in every box rather
than in the labels alone.

### Stage: filter by release stage

| Stage | |
|---|---|
| GA | Available now |
| Public Preview | |
| Beta | |
| Private Preview | |
| Coming soon | |

Each row carries the number of boxes it would show, and switching a stage off
removes those boxes from the platform, closes the gap and re-traces the ring.
Unstaged boxes always stay. An `st` value the app does not recognise is treated
as unstaged rather than quietly filed as available, because the conservative
reading is the honest one in front of a customer.

### Download

| Format | What you get |
|---|---|
| **PDF** | A cover with the title, the industry and cloud, the sentence the board leads with, and clickable links to the exact live board and to the industry's data model; an index page listing the sections; the architecture, vector text, in the current theme and palette; then four section breaks, each with one page per item, *Use Cases* (problem, beneficiary, build, components, story links), *Genie Agents* (the domain it serves, the data it reads, the teams and its top questions), *AI/BI Dashboards* (the KPIs it tracks and the teams that run on it) and *Databricks Apps*; then a closing page linking to the platform and the live board. All in the theme on screen and in Branded or Categorized names to match the board |
| **PowerPoint** | The same pages, as native slides: a cover, an index slide, a board slide of editable shapes, text boxes and connectors, then the *Use Cases*, *Genie Agents*, *AI/BI Dashboards* and *Databricks Apps* sections a slide per item, and a closing slide. Pictures are used only where the artwork is a real logo. The platform ring exports as one shape, filtered or not. The deck follows the theme and the Branded/Categorized choice on screen, so a categorized dark board exports a categorized dark deck |
| **PNG** | 2x raster of the current view |
| **GIF** | A looping animation, 1400px wide, twelve frames, that keeps the travelling dashes and the platform ring moving. Roughly 200 KB, because only the moving pixels are stored per frame, in the palette and theme on screen |
| **HTML** | A standalone copy of the page with your current choices baked in, which opens anywhere with no server |

Every download is named for what is in it, so a folder of them stays readable:
`databricks-airlines-reference-architecture.pdf`, and `-platform` on the end when
the platform zoom is on. The board carries
*(C) Databricks Industry Solutions* in its bottom right corner, on screen and in
every export.

## The detail drawer

Click any box.

![The detail drawer, opened on Unity Catalog](docs/screenshot-detail.png)

| Section | |
|---|---|
| **Stage badge** | GA, Beta or the preview the box is in |
| **What it is** | Plain English, no marketing |
| **Worth knowing** | The thing the name does not tell you |
| **Capabilities** | What it actually does |
| **Learn more** | Cloud-specific documentation, the cloud vendor's own page, the product page, and a blog or deep dive |
| **Related** | The boxes it touches, which highlight on the diagram and are one click away |

A Teams tile reads a little differently, because a team is not a product: the
panel names the team, says what it is accountable for, lists its sub-personas and
what each one cares about, and then lists the platform surfaces it actually works
in with one line each on what it uses them for, alongside the use cases the team
is interested in. Those surface and use-case names are clickable, so the panel is
a route into the diagram rather than a description beside it.

A use case tile carries its own story: the problem it solves, who benefits (a
team from the diagram, clickable), how it is built, the architecture components
it uses (each clickable), and links to Databricks customer stories where they
exist. On every board the use cases that have a story are shown first.

A source tile is enriched beyond its name: what the system does, who uses it, and
the data it produces, split into **Batch** and **Streaming**, each stamped with
the data shape (structured, semi-structured or unstructured), a typical volume
and a cadence. So a reader can see not just that a source feeds the platform but
what shape and how much data lands, and how often.

![An enriched source drawer, opened on Business Applications](docs/screenshot-source.png)

A Genie Agent tile carries the domain it serves as its subtitle, the same way a
use case carries its domain, then the governed data sources it reads (clickable
chips), the teams it serves, and the top questions it answers in plain language.
An AI/BI Dashboard tile names the KPIs and metrics it tracks and the teams that
run on it. Both live in their own bands, Genie Agents beside the use cases above
the platform, dashboards among the consumers, so the board says who asks the
questions and who reads the answers, not just where the data goes.

![A Genie Agent drawer, opened on the Customer & Revenue Agent](docs/screenshot-genie.png)

![An AI/BI Dashboard drawer, opened on Revenue & Growth](docs/screenshot-dashboard.png)

The three medallion layers open the data model for the industry on screen, so on
an airline board that is the
[airlines model](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/lakehouse-industry-data-models/tree/main/data-models/airlines)
rather than the catalogue root. They also open the
[launch blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/jumpstart-your-data-modeling-databricks-industry-data-models),
the
[Vibe Data Modeling blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/reimagining-data-modeling-lakehouse-introducing-vibe-data-modeling)
and the
[agent that generates the models](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/lakehouse-industry-data-models/tree/main/model-agent).

Every box is reachable by keyboard, and Escape closes the drawer.

## AI Architecture Assistant

The **Ask AI** button (bottom-right corner) lets you describe a customer or use case in plain language and get a tailored view of the platform — without restructuring the diagram.

- **Describe a customer → generated tab.** Type a use case (e.g. "a regional bank building a fraud detection platform") and the assistant generates a new, editable tab containing only the components that fit, each annotated with a short note on how it applies. The tab is persisted and editable like any other.
- **Industry auto-detection is a two-phase call.** The assistant first detects the industry from your text; if it matches one of the sixty-three built industries, it re-grounds the component selection on that industry's own board before building the tab — so the result reflects the right sources, teams and use cases, not the generic reference.
- **Type-ahead suggestion chips.** As you type, matching industry names surface above the input. Picking one switches the Reference board to that industry immediately — no AI call needed.
- **Usage notes on every component.** Each component in the generated tab carries a per-component note explaining how it applies to your use case; the same note appears on hover and in the detail drawer.
- **FastAPI backend, Databricks-hosted model.** The `/generate` endpoint in `app/app.py` calls `databricks-claude-sonnet-5` through the Databricks Foundation Model API using the app's own OAuth identity — no API key is needed when deployed. Locally, you can paste an Anthropic API key into the chat input as a fallback. Install Python dependencies with `pip install -r app/requirements.txt` before running locally.

---

## Tabs

The **Reference Architecture** tab is pinned and cannot be closed. **Edit**
clones the board on screen into a tab of your own: an independent working copy
that carries its own industry, cloud, palette, shape, stage and platform zoom,
so you can retarget and export it without touching the reference. One clone at a
time, so Edit steps aside while a clone is open and returns the moment you close
it. Rename a tab by double-clicking its name, and close it with its own x.

What is remembered between visits: theme, palette, platform shape, stage filter,
and your tabs, including which one was open. The cloud switch and Platform-only
start fresh on every load, because both are how you frame one conversation
rather than a preference.

---

## How to deploy

### Option 1: the installer notebook (recommended)

The repository ships an installer that creates the Databricks App and deploys
the diagram into it. It needs no catalog, no SQL warehouse and no data access:
the app serves one static file, and its service principal reads nothing.

1. In your Databricks workspace, choose **Workspace -> Create -> Git folder**
   and clone this repository.
2. Open **`app-installer.ipynb`** from inside that folder.
3. **Run All.** The defaults are correct for this path.
4. When it finishes it prints a link. The app also appears under
   **Compute -> Apps -> idea**.

Run All launches the install as a **tagged Databricks job**, prints the run URL,
waits for it, then surfaces the app link. The job carries `dbx_idea_installer_*`
tags (`app`, `kind`, `version`, `status`), so its serverless spend is
attributable in `system.billing.usage`, the same pattern the vibe-modelling
agent installer uses. If the running identity cannot create a job, the notebook
deploys inline instead, so the install still works, just untagged.

A Databricks App has no custom-tag field of its own, so the app's own ongoing
serverless spend is attributed through a **serverless usage policy**: set widget
4 to a policy id and the installer attaches it on create, and its tags flow to
`system.billing.usage`.

Widgets, if you want to change something:

| Widget | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `01_app_name` | `idea` | Name of the Databricks App. Lowercase letters, digits and dashes |
| `02_source` | Beside this notebook | Where the app files come from. Leave it alone when running from a Git folder |
| `03_github_repo` | this repo | Only read when `02_source` is *Download from GitHub* |
| `04_usage_policy_id` | empty | Optional serverless usage policy id to attribute the app's spend. Blank skips it |

Choose **Download from GitHub** if you imported only the notebook rather than
cloning the repository. It pulls the archive over HTTPS and writes the `app/`
folder into your workspace home. Two things have to be true for it to work: the
workspace needs outbound internet access, and the repository has to be readable
without a token. This repository is public, so only the first is left, and some
locked-down workspaces do not have it. A fork you keep private returns 404 to the
anonymous archive request, so use the Git folder path for one of those.

To upgrade later: **Pull** on the Git folder, then Run All again. The installer
reuses the existing app and redeploys it.

**Prerequisites**

- Databricks Apps enabled on the workspace (*Compute -> Apps*)
- Permission to create apps, which workspace admins have by default

**Cost.** The app runs on its own small serverless compute. Stop it from
*Compute -> Apps* when you are not showing it.

### Option 2: the CLI

If you would rather not run a notebook:

```bash
# 1. put the app files in the workspace
databricks workspace mkdirs "/Users/$USER/idea/app"
for f in index.html app.py app.yaml requirements.txt; do
  databricks workspace import "/Users/$USER/idea/app/$f" --file "app/$f" \
    --format AUTO --overwrite
done

# 2. create the app and deploy into it
databricks apps create idea
databricks apps deploy idea --source-code-path "/Workspace/Users/$USER/idea/app"
```

Redeploying after a change is the same two steps without `apps create`.

### Option 3: no Databricks at all

`app/index.html` is self-contained. Double-click it, or serve the folder:

```bash
cd app && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 app.py     # http://localhost:8000
```

## How it is built

**One file.** `app/index.html` carries the markup, the styles, the logic, the
architecture model and the logos. There is no bundler, no package manager and
nothing to install. Opening it from a file path works, which matters because
that is how most people will first see it.

**The model is data.** The architecture lives in a single `ARCH` object, and the
zones render from it. The reference material behind each box is a separate table
on purpose: `ARCH` is what a user edits and what gets saved and exported, while
the product descriptions, stages and links are fixed facts that have no business
being editable.

**Exports are written by hand.** The PDF, PowerPoint and GIF writers are in the
file: object tables and cross-reference offsets for the PDF, the parts and
relationships of an Office package for the PPTX, both carrying the cover, an
index, the board, then a page or slide per item across the Use Cases, Genie
Agents, AI/BI Dashboards and Databricks Apps sections, and a closing slide, with
clickable links throughout. Every section is laid out from the same tile data the
on-screen drawer reads, through one `deckSections()` source of truth, so the deck
and the drawer cannot drift, and each tile is relabelled Branded or Categorized
and picks up the live theme, so a categorized dark board exports a categorized
dark deck. Pulling in a library for each format would be more code than the
formats need, and would put the exports behind a network fetch that a workspace
with no internet egress would fail on.

**Colours are solved, not chosen.** `tools/palgen.py` takes a hue recipe per
zone and walks lightness until every foreground clears WCAG AA against the
surface it will actually sit on, in both themes, then emits the CSS.

**The animation survives export.** A raster export freezes every CSS animation,
so a naive GIF would be twelve identical frames. Each connector's travelling dot
is also expressed as a function of a `--dash-t` phase variable, which the GIF
encoder walks one step per frame. Only the moving pixels differ between frames,
and the encoder stores the rest as transparent, which is why twelve frames of a
1400px board fit in about 200 KB.

**The layout is measured, not tuned.** The board is laid out at a fixed design
width and then scaled to fit, and the two halves of the platform are balanced
after the first measurement and re-measured before the scale is applied. That is
why a shape change, a stage filter and a palette switch all land on the same
symmetrical geometry instead of drifting a few pixels each time.

**Content is written to a measured budget.** Because the board is scaled to fit,
content and type size are the same decision: a zone that grows by one tile
shrinks every label on the board. So the pockets are measured rather than
guessed. `tools/probe.py` injects a probe that clones tiles into a zone until the
board gets taller, which is how the eight-tile Teams pocket is an eight-tile
pocket, and `tools/heightgate.py` holds every industry to it in all five shapes.
