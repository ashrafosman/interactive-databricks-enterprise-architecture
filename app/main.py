"""Static server for Databricks Reference Architecture on Databricks Apps.

The diagram is one self-contained HTML file with no build step and no backend,
so the whole server is the standard library. Adding FastAPI or Flask here would
mean a requirements.txt, a pip resolve on every deploy, and a dependency set to
keep patched, all to hand back a file that never changes at runtime.

Databricks Apps terminates TLS, applies workspace authentication and routes the
request in, so this process only has to answer on the port it is given.
